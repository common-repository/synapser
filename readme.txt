Integrate Synapser.net Search Engine Dynamic Optimization "SEDO" functionalities on your Wordpress site.

== Description ==

[SYNAPSER](http://www.synapser.net/), the most effective Search Engine Dynamic Optmization "SEDO" application on the market to place your web site at the top of the list, however it may be coded, in all search enigines by harvesting your visitors' most relevant keywords automatically and weaving them directly, in the right place, into each and every page in real time, at each visit!
Synapser analyses the behaviour of the most important search engines and the Synapser algorithm adapts your site to take most advantage of them. 
When a visitor is sent to your web site, Synapser harvests the keywords which your visitor used to reach that page and then serves them up woven into that page to all subsequent visitors, (within user manageable title, meta-tag, description etc.) including web crawler searches, so improving ranking.

PS: You'll need a [Synapser.net API key and Public Domain Key](http://panel.synapser.net/) to use it.
You can choose the plan with paid subscriptions available for businesses and commercial sites.

== Installation ==

Upload the Synapser plugin to your Wordpress installation, Activate it, then go to Settings > Synapser menu and add your [Synapser.net API key and Public Domain Key](http://panel.synapser.net/).

Description of Plugin Options:

* Hash Key: is the private key, you can find on Synapser Panel
* Public Domain Key: is the public key, you can find on Synapser Panel
* Title mode: you can choose how to render the page title tag. Keep Original: maintain the original WP title (not raccomanded); Append: append Synapser title to the original WP title; Prepend: prepend Synapser title to the original WP title; Replace: replace the original WP title with Synapser title.
* Enable debug: enable the API debug mode, plase use only for debugging and problem solving. This option must be always deactivated on a production environment.

NOTE: about Title mode, both Append and Replace are raccomanded for a best SEO performance.

After that, Synapser will be active and it will start to collect users behaviours and populate pages and keywords for the website.
You can access to [Synapser Panel](http://panel.synapser.net/) to manage all website pages and attributes.
